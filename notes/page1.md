# The Film and Television Charity

**The Film and TV Charity**, formerly the **CTBF** (**Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund**), is the leading [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) charity for people who work in the film, cinema and television industries, whose careers cover all aspects of pre-production and beyond, from script to screen and in a variety of roles.

Operating out of its main office in London, their services are available across the whole of the UK.

The charity owns the trademark for the [Royal Film Performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Film_Performance), an event that has previously been attended by [HM The Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II) or other members of the British Royal Family. The most recent Royal Film Performance was in 2022 for the UK premiere of [Top Gun: Maverick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun:_Maverick) and was attended by [Prince William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William), and the [Duchess of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchess_of_Cambridge).

The charity runs a [24/7 Support Line](https://filmtvcharity.org.uk/your-support/support-line/). The support line is available to discuss legal queries, mental health and wellbeing, financial troubles, family issues, or bullying and discrimination.

## Better Mental Health/Looking Glass Survey

In 2019, the charity launched the Looking Glass Survey to explore the mental health conditions of the UK Film and TV industry. The results of this survey led the charity to create the Whole Picture Programme.

In 2021, the charity ran the Looking Glass Survey again and it showed there were still major problems within the industry in relation to work strain, bullying & harassment and Mental Health.

In 2022, the charity launched the third iteration of the Looking Glass Survey to measure the progress of work being done to tackle the Mental Health crisis facing the industry.

In 2020, the charity added a new goal to their mission. As part of this process, the charity published two written reports focusing on racism in the industry.
